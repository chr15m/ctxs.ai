# General guidance

- Please modify files as minimally as possible to accomplish the task.
- Don't make superfluous changes, whitespace changes, or changes to code that don't relate to the current goal.
- When doing frontend work assume the user already has the page open with a live-reloading server running and changes will be hot-loaded as you make them.
