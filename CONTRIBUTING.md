# Contributing context windows and prompts

ctxs.ai is meant as an open registry for context windows, for now you can add contexts under

```
./contexts/{your github username}/{context-slug}.md
```

To add a file use the following template

```md

---
title: 
description: 
provenance: 
---
the actual context prompt
```

`provenance` is meant to provide some background about how the context window was created (hand written, generated, edited, etc.)
